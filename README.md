# Sample Size Analysis for "Buy Health" Experiment

Consider a standard RCT, with the following treatment and control groups:

* The treatment group is assigned to the medical plan described [here](https://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/10/buy-health-not.html), where your "health provider" (1) can veto any treatment you want them to pay for, and (2) gets paid each year based on an evaluation of your quality of life.

* The control group is assigned to a standard medical plan, e.g. medicaid.

Assume there are $n / 2$ individuals in each group, so $n$ individuals in total.

The aim here is to determine the sample size $n$ required to gain a >80% probability of observing a statistically significant ($p < 0.05$) effect of the treatment.

I estimate the required sample size in the notebook `sample-size-analysis.ipynb`.
